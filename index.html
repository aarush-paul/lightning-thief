              <p>Rick Riordan, in full Richard Russell Riordan, Jr., (born June 5, 1964, San Antonio, Texas, U.S.), American author and teacher who was perhaps best known for his hugely popular Percy Jackson and the Olympians book series, which blends Greek mythology with modern-day characters and settings. Riordan attended North Texas State University (now University of North Texas) in Denton before transferring to the University of Texas at Austin, from which he graduated with bachelor’s degrees in history and English. He then received his teacher’s certification from the University of Texas at San Antonio. After teaching middle school in Texas and California for about 15 years, Riordan quit to dedicate himself to writing full-time. Riordan began his professional writing career with a mystery series centring on private investigator Jackson (“Tres”) Navarre. The first book, Big Red Tequila, was published in 1997, and the seventh and final installment, Rebel Island, appeared in 2007. He began writing for young adults after his son asked him to tell bedtime stories involving Greek gods. Once he related all the myths he knew, Riordan began making up stories, and the idea for Percy Jackson was created. Percy is a 12-year-old boy with both attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia, and he embarks on various adventures after learning that he is a demigod. The five-book series included The Lightning Thief (2005), The Sea of Monsters (2006), The Titan’s Curse (2007), The Battle of the Labyrinth (2008), and The Last Olympian (2009).</p>

              <h1>STORY DESCRIPTION</h1>
              <P>The Lightning Thief is a fantasy-adventure novel by Rick Riordan. It is the first of five novels in the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series. It is followed by The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, The Battle of the Labyrinth, and The Last Olympian. The concept of the novel was inspired by bedtime stories about ancient Greek heroes that Riordan told to his son, Haley, while he was growing up. Haley had been diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia, which prompted Riordan to create a protagonist, Percy, with ADHD and dyslexia as well. The novel was sold at auction to Miramax Books in 2005 and was later reprinted by two other publishers, Penguin Books and Disney-Hyperion. Upon release, the novel received mostly positive reviews, with Publisher's Weekly calling it "swift and humorous." The novel received similar praise from The School Library Journal, which called it "an adventure-quest with a hip edge." It has sold over 2 million copies since publication and was adapted as a major motion picture in 2010. The novel appeared on the New York Times Bestsellers List as well as being one of the Library Services Association's Best Books for Young Adults.</P>

              <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
              <p>Percy Jackson is a 12 year old boy. He has ADHD and dyslexia. He has been thrown out of many schools. On a trip with his mother, he meets his friend Grover. Grover tells Percy's mother that Percy must go to a camp. When they drive towards the camp, a Minotaur attacks them and grabs Percy's mother. She dissolves into gold sparkles of light, but Grover and Percy escape. Percy later wakes up. He learns that he is in Camp Half-Blood, which is a secret training camp for demigods. Percy has to live in the Hermes cabin because he does not know which god his father is. He is under the care of Luke Castellan, the cabin counselor. During a game, the children of the war god Ares attack Percy. He is healed when he steps into a river. When Poseidon's trident appears above his head, Percy learns that he is Poseidon's son. After World War II, Poseidon, Hades and Zeus made an oath not to have any more children because they were too powerful. However, Poseidon broke the oath by having Percy. Chiron tells Percy to find Zeus' master lightning bolt. Chiron thinks Hades stole the bolt. However, Zeus discovers that Poseidon has broken his oath, and thinks Poseidon told Percy to steal the bolt. He tells Percy that he has ten days until the summer solstice to find it. Before leaving, Luke gives Percy magic shoes. Percy gives them to Grover. Annabethand Grover join Percy in his quest to find the bolt. They decide to travel west to reach the entrance to the Underworld, which is in Los Angeles. They meet many Greek monsters. They also meet Ares. Ares tells Percy that his mother is alive. When they come near the pit of Tartarus, Luke’s shoes try to pull Grover into it, but he escapes. Percy meets Hades, who also thinks Percy stole the Master Bolt. He also thinks Percy stole his Helm of Darkness. Percy knows that Ares has tricked him when he finds the bolt in his backpack. He runs away from the Underworld. Ares gives Percy the Helm of Darkness. Percy gives it back to Hades. Olympus is now present at the top of the Empire State Building in New York City. Percy arrives there to give the master bolt to Zeus. Percy goes back to camp after hearing that his mother is alive. He goes to a new school and stays with his mother instead of staying at camp.</p>
